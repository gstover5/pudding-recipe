    <h1>INGREDIENTS:</h1>
<hr/>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups milk
            <ul>
                <li>whole milk is preferred, can sub 2% and heavy cream. lower fat milk will not work.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>4 egg yolks
            <ul>
                <li>DO NOT TOUCH THE EGGS WITHOUT READING THE INSTRUCTIONS</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            1/2 cup of sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tsp of vanilla extract
            <ul>
                <li>reserve until the end</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons of cornstarch
            <ul>
                <li>do not add all the cornstarch at once. do a tablespoon at a time until you find your consistency</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h1>INSTRUCTIONS:</h1>
    <HR/>
    <ol>
        <li>over medium heat, slowly heat milk and half the sugar stirring frequently</li>
        <li>once the milk is warm (almost boiling but not) seperate egg yolks into a medium mixing bowl 
            <ul>
                <li>THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT</li>
                <li>do NOT touch the eggs until the milk is to temp. you have to do the next part fast or you'll make a bowl of snot.</li>
                <li>mix the remaining sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch. whisk to combine.</li>
                <li>SLOWLY add 1 cup of the warm milk mixture to the bowl whisking constantly. You are tempering the egg yolks without making scrambled eggs. If you do it to fast, start over. you'll know.</li>
                <li>return mix to pot on stove DO NOT STOP WHISKING</li>
                <li>continue to heat over low medium heat until mixture thickens.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>turn off heat</li>
        <li>add butter, mixture will thicken further once you add the additional fat from the butter</li>
        <li>add flavoring of choice AND vanilla extract. don't do one or the other.</li>
        <li>at this point custard may be slighly lumpy. Personally I prefer to run it through a fine sieve and filter any lumps out.</li>
        </ol>
        <h1>VERY IMPORTANT</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>you CAN NOT put this in a bowl and put it in the fridge. You will make a solid chunk of pudding skin by morning.</li>
            <li>find a bowl that the pudding will ALMOST fill, cover with plastic wrap TOUCHING THE PUDDING. This will prevent it from thickening in the fridge.</li>
        </ul>

    </ol>
